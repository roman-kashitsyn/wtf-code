*** DONE Foldsubtree works bad on nested folds
    To reproduce:
    - Fold child subree.
    - Fold parent subree.
    - Expand parent subree.
    Expected result: parent subree expanded up to child subree.
    Actual result: parent subree expanded fully, and there is "Expand subree"
    label on child node.
